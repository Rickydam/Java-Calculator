#v1.0
- Can add, substract, divide and multiply with two numbers only once (so far)
- The menu bar has a clear and a quit option

------------------- Bugs -------------------------                                        
-> symbol means what the program should do

- The calculator can only be used once so far. When the = button is pressed, the calculator will not work properly anymore because it has not yet been implemented                                   
-> Make the calculator continuous

- The decimal button does not have implementation yet                                         
-> It should put a decimal

------------------- Add -------------------------                                              

- Add code for the decimal
- Want to be able to use again even after the (=) button has been pressed
- Add a clear button
- Add a clear all button
- Pressing an operator after second number acts as an equal
